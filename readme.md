# Django-React Authentication using Knox and Redux

## Overview

I wanted to create a basic starting point for a project with authentication. This repo has 2 parts, the Django back end and the React Front end. The Django project contains a users app, and uses DRF/ Knox in order to handle user registration and authentication.

This is connected to the React Front end, which communicates with the back end via Axios, and uses Redux for state management.

This was mostly done by following this blog post - http://v1k45.com/blog/modern-django-part-4-adding-authentication-to-react-spa-using-drf/ 
with a few changes here and there.

There may be some bugs with this project, that may not be discovered until it's expanded on.
